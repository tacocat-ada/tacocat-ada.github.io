_"It's Not What You Know. It's Who You Know"_

Everyone has heard this quote or experienced it first hand. It is no secret that social network has a large impact on career and personal life.

Even going further, we could argue that this quote is created by someone from the movie industry. In this project we analyzed the
social network of actors, writers and directors. We used the [CMU Movie Summary Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) dataset to do our analysis.

We analyzed the large social network by dividing into clusters and then we zoomed into the significant clusters to further investigate the people who know each other, why these clusters exist and who are the key people that bridge different clusters. For each cluster, we looked at their common attributes and tied them into real-life clusters such as Bollywood, Hollywood etc.

# The Data We Worked With

- Explain the time period we chose, why, number of people, graph of the clusters we have

# Cluster 1

- Cluster size, the common attributes, statistics of gender, ethnicity, age etc.
- Try to name the cluster to the real-life cluster (is it hollywood etc.)

# Cluster 2

# Cluster 3

# Outliers / Key people

# Conclusion
